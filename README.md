# 🌟 **DevFolio** - Mahak Patel's Playground Portfolio  

**"I didn't just build a portfolio—I coded an experience (with dad jokes included)."**  

🚀 **[Live Demo](https://oyemahak.github.io/DevFolio/)** | 💻 **Raw Vanilla JS Magic** | 🎮 **Mini-Games Inside!**

## **✨ Why This Portfolio Isn’t Just Another `<div>` in the Wall**  

✅ **100% Custom-Coded** – No Bootstrap, no templates, just pure **HTML, CSS & JS sorcery**  
✅ **4 Thematic Vibes** – Moon 🌙, Snow ❄️, Rain 🌧️, Dark Mode 🕶️ *(Light Mode coming soon for vampires)*  
✅ **Mini-Games** – Because why *just* show skills when you can *play* with them?  
✅ **UX + Dev Projects** – Proof I speak both "`border-radius`" *and* "user empathy"  
✅ **Hidden Easter Eggs** 👀 *(Find my secret comments if you dare… but hands off my code!)*

## **🛠️ Tech Stack (a.k.a. My Digital Toolbelt)**  

```
HTML5   – The skeleton (but with better semantics)  
CSS3    – The glitter and glow (animations included)  
JS      – The wizard behind the curtain  
Git     – Time-travel for code mistakes  
VSCode  – Where the magic happens (and bugs are born)  
```

**No frameworks were harmed in the making of this portfolio.**

## **🎮 Mini-Games & Hidden Fun**  

- **"Console Wars"** – Check your dev tools. I *might* have left surprises…  
- **Theme Toggle Roulette** – Will it rain? Snow? Become a moonlit night?  
- **90s Kid?** Try the Konami Code *(↑↑↓↓←→←→BA)*. Just saying.
